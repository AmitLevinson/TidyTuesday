Getting data: 

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-06-02')
marbles <- tuesdata$marbles

tidytuesdayR::readme(tuesdata)
```

```{r}
glimpse(marbles)
```

Exploring players time distribution across games for each team?

```{r}
marbles %>% 
  group_by(team_name, marble_name) %>% 
  summarise(mean_time = mean(avg_time_lap)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x= mean_time, y= team_name))
```

Maybe the cummulative points for each team? Yes!

```{r}
cumsum_marbles <- marbles %>%
  #remove observations with na points
  filter(!is.na(points)) %>%
  group_by(team_name) %>% 
  # Transform date to date column
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%d-%B-%y"),
         # Make pnts cummulative
         cum_pnts = cumsum(points)) %>%
  # remove irrelevant observations
  distinct(team_name, date,cum_pnts) %>%
  # create criteria to higlight by
  mutate(highlight = case_when(team_name == "Savage Speeders" ~ "savage",
                               team_name == "Hazers" ~ "hazers",
                               TRUE ~ "n"),
         # Have the Savage Speeders with a line break (too long of a name)
         team_name = ifelse(team_name == "Savage Speeders", "Savage\nSpeeders", team_name)) %>% 
  arrange(-cum_pnts) %>% 
  ungroup()
